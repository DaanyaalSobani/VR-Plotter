# VR-Plotter
A webapp that plots multi variable functions onto a VR enviroment. 
Pretty much what it sounds like. You enter a function of the form f(x,y) and a VR enviroment is generated so you can fly around and examine
the various features of the function.

To use you can either go to:

Or download everything and run it on a local server. Enter the function in the prompt on the index.html. You will be redirected to the 
VR enviroment.
